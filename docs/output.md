# nf-core/tumourevo: Output
## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. All plots generated in each step are summarised into the final report.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to both published and unpublished results. 



## Pipeline overview

<!-- The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
and processes data using the following steps:

* [Variant Annotation](#variant-annotation) - annotation of variants and cohort summary visualization
* [Formatter](#formatter) - coversion of files to different formats (unpubblished)
* [Lifter](#lifter) - pileup of private mutations of the other samples in multi-sample setting
* [Driver Annotation](#driver-annotation) - _add description_ (unpubblished)
* [QC](#qc) - quality control of copy-number and somatic mutation calling and creation of multi-CNAqc object
* [Subclonal Deconvolution](#subclonal-deconvolution) - 
* [Signature Deconvolution](#signature-deconvolution) - 

Intermediate steps of the pipeline will output unpublished results which will be available for the user in the working directory of the pipeline. -->

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and consists in five main subworkflows:

* [Variant Annotation](#variant-annotation)
* [QC](#qc)
* [Signature Deconvolution](#signature-deconvolution)
* [Subclonal Deconvolution](#subclonal-deconvolution)

Intermediate steps connetting the main subworkflows will output [unpublished results](#unpublished-results) which will be available in the working directory of the pipeline. These steps consist in:

* [Formatter](#formatter)
* [Lifter](#lifter)
* [Driver Annotation](#driver-annotation)

## Variant Annotation

This directory contains results from the variant annotation subworkflow. At the level of individual samples, genomic variants present in the input VCF files are annotated using [VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) and further converted into MAF format using [vcf2maf](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf). Genomic information of samples from the same cohort are summarized into a unique MAF object with [maftools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maftools.html).

### VEP
[VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) is a `Ensembl` tool that determines the effect of all variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence.
This step starts from VCF files.

<summary>Output files for all samples</summary>

**Output directory: `{publish_dir}/VariantAnnotation/VEP/<dataset>/<patient>/<sample>/`**

- `vep.vcf.gz`
  - annotated VCF file


</details>


### vcf2maf

[vcf2maf](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf) convert a VCF file into a MAF (Mutation Annotation Format) file, where each variant is mapped to only one of all possible gene transcripts/isoforms that it might affect. vcf2maf is designed to work with VEP annotation output. 

> **NB:** While VEP is tolerant of chromosome format mismatches (when the input .VCF file uses the UCSC format chrN and the reference fasta uses Ensembl/NCBI format N), vcf2maf is not.
>  Make sure the reference fasta chromosome format matches that of your input

### maftools

[maftools]( https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maftools.html) is an R-based tool that provides a comprehensive set of functions for processing MAF files and to perform most commonly used analyses in cancer genomics. In particular, maftools summarize, analyze and visualize MAF files from the same cohort providing summary statistics of the top mutated genes and aggregating metadata into a single oncoplot visualization.
This step started from annotated MAF files.

MAF fields requirements:

- Mandatory fields: `Hugo_Symbol`, `Chromosome`, `Start_Position`, `End_Position`, `Reference_Allele`, `Tumor_Seq_Allele2`, `Variant_Classification`, `Variant_Type` and `Tumor_Sample_Barcode`.

- Optional fields: `VAF` (Variant Allele Frequency), `amino acid change` information.

  - oncoprint plot

</details>

<!-- ## Lifter

The Lifter subworkflow is an optional step and it is run when `--mode multisample` is used. When multiple samples from the same patient are provided, the user can specify either a single joint VCF file, containing variant calls from all tumor samples of the patient, or individual sample specific VCF files. In the latter case, path to tumor BAM files must be provided in order to collect all mutations from the samples and perform pile-up of sample's private mutations in all the other samples. Two intermediate steps, [get_positions](#get_positions) and [mpileup](#mpileup), are performed to identify private mutations in all the samples and retrieve their variant allele frequency. Once private mutations are properly defined, they are merged back into the original VCF file during the [join_positions](#join_positions) step. The updated VCF file is then converted into a `vcfR` RDS object.

The output files of [get_positions](#get_positions) and [mpileup](#mpileup) are intermediate and by default not kept in the result directory.

### join_positions
In this step, all retrieved mutations are joined with original mutations present in input VCF, which is in turn converted into an RDS object using [vcfR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcfR/vignettes/intro_to_vcfR.html).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files for all samples</summary>

**Output directory: `{publish_dir}/lifter/mpileup/<dataset>/<patient>/<sample>/`**
- `pileup_VCF.rds`
  - RDS containing shared and private mutations

</details> -->

## QC
The QC subworkflows requires in input a segmentation file from allele-specific copy number callers (either [Sequenza](https://sequenzatools.bitbucket.io/#/home), [ASCAT](https://github.com/VanLoo-lab/ascat)) and the joint VCF file from [join_positions](#join_positions) subworkflow. The QC sub-workflows first conduct quality control on CNV and somatic mutation data for individual samples in [CNAqc](#cnaqc) step, and subsequently summarize validated information at patient level in [join_CNAqc](#join_cnaqc) step.
The QC subworkflow is a crucial step of the pipeline as it ensures high confidence in identifying clonal and subclonal events while accounting for variations in tumor purity.

### CNAqc
[CNAqc](https://caravagnalab.github.io/CNAqc/) is a package to quality control (QC) bulk cancer sequencing data for validating copy number segmentations against variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations.

<details markdown="1">

## Signature Deconvolution

<!-- Mutational signatures represent characteristic patterns of somatic mutations in cancer genomes, reflecting the underlying mutational processes at the basis of tumor evolution and progression. Mutational signatures are discovered by analyzing ensemble point-mutation counts from a set of individual samples. Validated mutations from [join_CNAqc](#join_cnaqc) step are converted into a TSV joint table in (see [tsvparse](#tsvparse) module), subsequently given as input to signature deconvolution subworkflow, which performs de novo extraction, inference, deciphering or deconvolution of mutational counts.  -->

Mutational signatures are distinctive patterns of somatic mutations in cancer genomes that reveal the underlying mutational processes driving tumor evolution and progression. These signatures are identified by analyzing aggregated point-mutation counts from multiple samples. Validated mutations from the [join_CNAqc](#join_cnaqc) step are converted into a joint TSV table (see [tsvparse](#tsvparse)) and then input into the signature deconvolution subworkflow, which performs de novo extraction, inference, interpretation, or deconvolution of mutational counts.

The results of this step are collected in `{pubslish_dir}/signature_deconvolution/`. Two tools can be specified by using `--tools` parameter: [SparseSignatures](#sparsesignatures) and [SigProfiler](#sigprofiler).

### SparseSignatures

[SparseSignatures](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SparseSignatures.html) is an R-based computational framework that provides a set of functions to extract and visualize the mutational signatures that best explain the mutation counts of a large number of patients.

### SigProfiler

[SigProfiler](https://osf.io/t6j7u/wiki/home/) is a python framework that allows _de novo_ extraction of mutational signatures from data generated in a matrix format. The tool identifies the number of operative mutational signatures, their activities in each sample, and the probability for each signature to cause a specific mutation type in a cancer sample. The tool makes use of `SigProfilerMatrixGenerator` and `SigProfilerPlotting`, seamlessly integrating with other `SigProfiler` tools.

## Subclonal Deconvolution

The subclonal deconvolution subworkflow requires in input a joint `mCNAqc` object resulting from the [join_CNAqc](#join_cnaqc) step. Two different modalities can be specified by the user using `--mode` parameter: single sample and multi sample mode.
<!-- If `--mode singlesample` is provided, each sample is analysed individually providing a snapshot of clonal and subclonal diversity starting from allele frequency of detected somatic variants. When multiple samples from the same patient are provided, the user may take advantage of the multisample modality, by setting `--mode multisample`. -->
<!-- This approach allows for a more detailed and accurate identification of subclonal populations, as it can capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity within the tumor. By integrating data across multiple samples, it improves the resolution of subclonal structures and provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics and progression of the tumor. -->

<!-- Various tools can be specified using the `--tools` parameter, leading to different methods for performing subclonal deconvolution analysis. Among the available tools, [MOBSTER](https://caravagnalab.github.io/mobster/) operates only on single samples but can still be specified for use in multi-sample mode, while [VIBER](https://caravagnalab.github.io/VIBER/index.html) and [PyClone-VI](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03919-2) can operates in both modalities. In case `--mode multisample` and `--tools mobster,pyclone-vi` are specified, first MOBSTER is run on individual samples to remove tail mutations and then PyClone-VI operates a multivariate subclonal deconvolution on the preprocessed MOBSTER mutations. A similar procedure is perfomed when  `--mode multisample` and `--tools mobster,viber` are defined. More detailed explanation is provided in the following sections.  -->

The results of subclonal decovnultion step are collected in `{publish_dir}/subclonal_deconvolution/` directory.

### Single sample

If `--mode singlesample` is provided, each sample is analysed individually providing a snapshot of clonal and subclonal diversity starting from allele frequency of detected somatic variants. Available tools provides different ways of performing subclonal deconvolution. Both MOBSTER and VIBER model mutation counts as mixture of binomial distribution; however, MOBSTER includes a pareto Type-I power law distribution to model within-clone neutral dynamics. Instead, PyClone-VI models clonal architecture taking into account variant allele frequencies corrected for coincident copy number variation.

#### MOBSTER

[MOBSTER](https://caravagnalab.github.io/mobster/) processes mutant allelic frequencies to identify and remove neutral tails from the input data, so that subclonal reconstruction algorithms can be applied downstream to find subclones from the processed read counts.

### Multi samples

When multiple samples for the same patient are available (e.g. multi-regional or longitudinal experiment), we can be intersted in visualizing the tumor evolution at different level. In multi sample mode, a patient-specific subclonal deconvolution is perfomed.

> **NB:** At this stage, it is strongly recommended that the user conducts single-sample subclonal deconvolution using `mosbter` to eliminate mutations assigned to the neutral tail before proceeding with multi-variate clone identification.
> This process ensures a cleaned signal for downstream analyses aimed at focusing on functional intratumor heterogeneity.

## Clone Tree Inference

Subclonal deconvolution results are used to build clone tree from both single samples and multple samples using [ctree](https://caravagnalab.github.io/ctree/index.html). ctree is a R-based package which implements basic functions to create, manipulate and visualize clone trees by modelling Cancer Cell Fractions (CCF) clusters. Annotated driver genes must be provided in the input data.

> **NB:** When `-- tools pyclone-vi` is used, the output of PyClone-VI subclonal deconvolution is preprocessed prior to clone tree inference. Since ctree requires labeling one of the clusters as "clonal," the one with the highest CCF across all samples is choosen.

VIBER and MOBSTER fits are already suitable for ctree analysis.

### Lifter
<!-- The Lifter subworkflow is optional in multi-sample mode, when for a patient more samples are provided. The sub-workflow collect all mutations from the samples and perform pile-up of sample's private mutations in all the other samples. -->

The Lifter subworkflow is an optional step and it is run when `--mode multisample` is used. When multiple samples from the same patient are provided, the user can specify either a single joint VCF file, containing variant calls from all tumor samples of the patient, or individual sample specific VCF files. In the latter case, path to tumor BAM files must be provided in order to collect all mutations from the samples and perform pile-up of sample's private mutations in all the other samples. Two intermediate steps, [get_positions](#get_positions) and [mpileup](#mpileup), are performed to identify private mutations in all the samples and retrieve their variant allele frequency. Once private mutations are properly defined, they are merged back into the original VCF file during the [join_positions](#join_positions) step. The updated VCF file is then converted into a `vcfR` RDS object.

#### get_positions
This intermediate step allows to retrieve private and shared mutations across samples originated from the same patient.
